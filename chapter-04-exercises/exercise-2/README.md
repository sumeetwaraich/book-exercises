# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.


| **Course Number** | **Course Title** | **Instructor**|
| :-----------------:| :-------------------------------------:| :--------------: |
| **INFO 201**       | _Technical Foundations of Informatics_ | Kyle Thayer      |
| **PHIL 115**       | _Practical Reasoning_                  | Conor Mayo-Wilson|
| **SOC 225**        | _Data and Society_                     | Zack Almquist    |
